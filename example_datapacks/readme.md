# Here is a set of example datapacks for pokecube

These should go in config/pokecube/datapacks, and the ones which affect pokemob databases require a server reboot to apply.

## Contents:

-  no_spawns.zip - This removes all spawns specified by pokecube mobs and pokecube legends
-  new_subbiomes.zip - This adds a subbiome 'route_1', which has a spawns for Rattata and Pidget, and a subbiome `route_23`, with spawns for Arbok and Sandslash
