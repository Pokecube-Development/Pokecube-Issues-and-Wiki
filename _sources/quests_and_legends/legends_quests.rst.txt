# **Making Type: Null**
Type: Null is a pokemon created in the laboratory, so there's nothing more fair than creating it inside the Pokecube too :b

The first step is to find Aether Paradise, is the new structure that appears in the oceans:

    :alt: Aether_Paradise

In it, you will find some NPCs to battle, and reaching the top floor you will find the NPC Faba

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/sI7pTSb.png
    :alt: Faba_Pokecube

Defeating him, you can open the trade menu, and there you will find Imprisonment Helmet, the main item to create Type: Null

>Now comes the part you need to pay attention to!
You will need: Potion of Regeneration, Imprisonment Helmet, Two Pokemob egg
